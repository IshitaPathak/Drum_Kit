### How it Works??
Created a number of keys that represent drums in the drum-kit and when you click on the buttons it will create correspondings sound of the drum and in addition you can also use the corresponding keys on the keyboard to create sound as the which key to press is written on the buttons.
Added addEventListener to buttons and key strokes so that drum beats will create sound when user is tapping on the keyoard and clicking on the buttons.
